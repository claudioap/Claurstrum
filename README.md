Claurstrum
==========

This will be (hopefully) a tool that aims at the purpose of simplifying the creation of pre-production operating system environments.

Its full operation should be the deployment of a GNU/Linux operating system (not being too tied to any in specific, and easily portable) onto a hard-drive, and based on such operating system defaults for its services (http, ftp, dns, etc...) being able to prompt the user for their configurations.

It its **not meant** to be a *Setup Your System For Dummies*, the user should be aware of what its happening if it is meant to be put into production.

Right now the only purpose of such tool is to save a few minutes at every setup, yet preventing an administrator to miss any crucial step.

### Notes

As of now, this is a project meant for professional evaluation.
I have compromised myself to conclude the essential of this application before the end of June/14.
I should **not** accept any contribution to this project, yet I accept tips and suggestions.
Contributions can only be received only after the deadline, but feel free to fork if you need it!
